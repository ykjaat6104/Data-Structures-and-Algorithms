Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) 🚀
📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations and explanations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. It is designed to help students and professionals strengthen their problem-solving skills.

📚 Topics Covered
1️⃣ Data Structures
Arrays

Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

Stacks

Queues

Hash Maps / Hash Tables

Heaps / Priority Queues

Trees (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, Trie, Segment Tree, etc.)

Graphs (Adjacency List, Matrix, DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)

2️⃣ Algorithms
Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort, etc.)

Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, Ternary Search, etc.)

Recursion & Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, etc.)

Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, LIS, LCS, etc.)

Greedy Algorithms

Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd Warshall, etc.)

Divide & Conquer (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
